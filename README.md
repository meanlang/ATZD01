# ATZD01
ATZD01 was collected by Professor ZhiYong Tao's team at Liaoning Technical University. The dataset contains 20,272 samples across 6,055 images, divided into 11 categories:
1.	Mite Infestation: 4,325 samples
2.	Bacterial Shot Hole: 9,023 samples
3.	Gummosis: 1,170 samples
4.	Scabbed Disease: 1,753 samples
5.	Brown Rot: 480 samples
6.	Anthracnose: 530 samples
7.	Carposina Sasakii Matsumura Infestation: 135 samples
8.	Aromia Bungii Infestation: 330 samples
9.	Cnidocampa Flavescens Walker Infestation: 1,381 samples
10.	Hyphantria Cunea Infestation: 671 samples
11.	Chilocorus Rubidus Hope: 474 samples

Notably, in addition to traditional pests and diseases, we also include one beneficial insect species, Chilocorus Rubidus Hope, which we believe provides valuable insights for orchard managers and growers to better understand the overall pest and disease situation in apricot orchards. Specific category images are shown below.

ATZD01 contains numerous challenging sample images, such as those taken in backlight conditions, direct sunlight, complex backgrounds, multiple samples, and low-light scenarios, as shown below:

Additionally, ATZD01 includes samples captured from multiple angles, with a significant number of leaf underside samples, as shown below:

Annotations were manually created using the Labelimg software and are provided in the standard YOLO format. In our study, we randomly divided the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets with a ratio of 8:1:1. We also encourage future researchers to partition the dataset based on their specific task requirements.

Our images contain some annotation information within the file names. The naming convention for the image files is "Apricot_Weather_CaptureDevice_Number." For example, "Apricot_Cloudy day_Canon EOS 6D_2452" indicates that the image of the apricot tree was taken on a cloudy day using a Canon EOS 6D camera, and the image number is 2452. We have adopted this approach to encourage future researchers to re-annotate or modify the annotation information to further advance the field of apricot tree pest and disease detection.

The images in ATZD01 come in various resolutions, all in high-definition JPG format. To ensure that subsequent researchers have access to the original images, we have not compressed them. The total size of the dataset is 15.4 GB.
